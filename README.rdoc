== General Assembly Project 3 - API fun

This was my final project while I was studying the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. I thought it would be fun to build a web app that people could use while waiting for a flight or train, etc. or just for general amusement. It's designed around eight squares, each of which spins round and fetches random content from a different api, depending on which square the user clicks on. A multipurpose, central ninth square serves as a login/user profile page and trending dashboard. I built this using Ruby on Rails, JQuery, lots of CSS animation and a bit of AngularJS. 

I'm still playing around with various APIs and the design, so it's still very much a work in progress. At the moment you can sign up and save stuff to your profile. Eventually you'll also be able to share content you like to facebook and twitter. Fun times.

It was originally, and rather unimaginatively, called "9 squares", but I renamed it ".rS" for "random stuff" or something along those lines...
