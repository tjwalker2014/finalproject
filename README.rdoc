== Project 3 Multiple APIs

For my final project I chose to build a fun web app, designed around eight squares, each of which would spin round and fetch random content from a different API, depending on which square the user clicked on. A multipurpose, central ninth square served as a login/user profile page and trending dashboard. Built using Rails, JQuery, lots of CSS animation and a bit of AngularJS.
